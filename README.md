# Sudoku-Solver
A Sudoku Solver that uses various techniques to decrease solve time such as:
- Combination of logically solving and backtracking (rather than completely backtracking)
- I think that's the only thing 

Run gui.py to run (not solver.py). Make sure you are using python 3 and have pygame installed aswell.
